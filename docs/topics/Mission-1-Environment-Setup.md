# Mission 1: Environment Setup 🛠️

Welcome, intrepid Python explorer! Your first mission is to prepare your coding workspace. Just as a chef needs a
well-equipped kitchen, a Python developer needs a properly set up environment. Let's get you ready for the coding
adventures ahead!

## Your Objectives

In this mission, you'll:

1. Install Python on your system
2. Set up a code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
3. Learn about virtual environments
4. Explore managing different Python versions

## Why This Matters

A well-configured environment will:

- Make your coding process smoother
- Help you avoid common pitfalls
- Allow you to manage projects more effectively
- Prepare you for real-world development scenarios
